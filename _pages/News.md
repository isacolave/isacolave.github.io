   <span style="font-size: 0.7em;">Road transportation is one of the most carbon-emitting sectors in the economy, urging the implementation of strategies to reach climate goals. Carpooling is considered a promising innovation for carbon mitigation. This paper evaluates the impact of environmental policies, both direct, such as subsidies for novice carpooling drivers, and indirect, with the French carbon tax, on the adoption of carpooling. As carpooling may make car travel more appealing, it potentially leads to ambiguous environmental outcomes. This study introduces the vehicle occupancy rate as a reliable metric to assess potential carbon mitigation, which encompasses travelers' preferences for other transport modes. Leveraging a unique dataset provided by France's leading carpooling platform, we assess the greenhouse gas reduction impact related to aforementioned policies. Our findings suggest that increasing the cost of travel through carbon pricing not only enhances carpooling demand and supply but also improves the occupancy rate. Regarding carpooling subsidies to novice drivers, we show that novice users are even more sensitive to adopting carpool with the cost of travel. Additionally, our study highlights the potential benefits of encouraging drivers to become passengers, a strategy not currently implemented, and could lead to a better designed policy. These insights are key for policymakers aiming to design more effective strategies for reducing vehicle emissions and achieving climate targets.</span>
