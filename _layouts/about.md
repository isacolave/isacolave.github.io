<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am a postdoctoral fellow at <a href=\"https://neoma-bs.fr/" title=\"NEOMA BS\">NEOMA Business School</a>.<p> 
<p>I received my PhD at the <a href=\"https://chairgovreg.fondation-dauphine.fr/" title=\"GovReg\">Governance and Regulation Chair</a> of the University Paris Dauphine - PSL.<p>
<p>Before joining Paris Dauphine, I completed the APE Master’s program at PSE and a Master’s degree in Economics at ITAM in Mexico. I worked as a Junior Analyst at the Mexican Petroleum Fund, part of the Central Bank of Mexico.<p>
<p>My research in applied economics lies at the intersection of regulatory economics, industrial organization, and public management. My work focuses on two key areas: designing and evaluating regulatory frameworks that leverage emerging technologies to create efficient and sustainable systems, particularly in transportation and energy, and improving public procurement rules to enhance efficiency while advancing broader policy objectives.<p>
