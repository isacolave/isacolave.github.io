<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am a postdoctoral fellow at <a href=\"https://neoma-bs.fr/" title=\"NEOMA BS\">NEOMA Business School</a>.<p> 
<p>I received my PhD at the <a href=\"https://chairgovreg.fondation-dauphine.fr/" title=\"GovReg\">Governance and Regulation Chair</a> of the University Paris Dauphine - PSL under the supervision of Eric Brousseau.<p>
<p>Before my PhD, I completed the APE Master’s program at Paris School of Economics and a Master’s degree in Economics at ITAM in Mexico. I worked as a Junior Analyst at the Mexican Petroleum Fund, a department of the Central Bank.<p>
<p>My research lies at the intersection of regulatory economics, industrial organization, and public management with a focus on the ecological transition and digital transformation. It is structured around two main areas: evaluating regulatory frameworks to integrate emerging digital platforms and, improving public procurement regulations to advance broader policy objectives.<p>
